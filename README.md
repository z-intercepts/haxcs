***an old-school roguelike with a computer science theme***

This is a project I started for fun and to get a bit more familiar with Python
programming. It's a very simple coffee-break roguelike; the dungeons are small,
the enemies are limited, and many other standard roguelike elements like
weapons, armor, wands, scrolls, etc. are non-existent. I may continue to add new
things; we shall see how motivated I am.

In any case, I am releasing it as open source in the hopes that others might
enjoy it, improve it, and/or learn from it. It's still a very simple game so if
you were looking for a launching pad to write your own roguelike, it shouldn't
be hard to take this project and adapt it to a different theme.

If you are interested in extending it, feel free to fork and edit to your
heart's content. You may of course submit a merge request if you think I would
be interested in having your changes in my version; however, this is a project I
am pursuing for my own amusement and satisfaction, so I am likely to be
somewhat resistant to accepting others' changes to it.

Finally, if you were looking for a guide to playing the game; sorry, that
doesn't exist. It's a roguelike--go learn by dying! :) With that said, it's a
pretty easy roguelike, and if you can't figure things out on your own, feel free
to read through the source code for hints.

Enjoy!
